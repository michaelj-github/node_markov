# Markov Machines

A Markov Machine emits output of a “Markov Chain.”

A Markov Chain is a chain of possible outcomes, given a particular “state”.

For example, consider the phrase “the cat in the hat is in the hat”. We could build a table of each word in this phrase, along with the word that comes after that phrase:

```
the cat, hat, hat
cat in
in the, the
hat is, null
is in
```

To emit realistic-but-random text, we could pick a starting word randomly (say, “in”). Then we would:

    find all words that can come after that word
    pick one of those next-words randomly
    if we picked null, we’ve reached the end of the chain, so stop
    otherwise, restart at step 1

For example, from that simple phrase, we could find:

    “in the cat in the hat”
    “in the hat is in the hat”
    “in the cat in the cat in the cat in the hat”

Step 0: Setup

    Make a project, a Git repo, and a package.json
    Add node_modules to your .gitignore

Step 1: Implement the Markov Machine

We’ve given you the start of an object-oriented Markov machine:
markov.js

```
/\*_ Textual markov chain generator _/


class MarkovMachine {

  /** build markov machine; read in text.*/

  constructor(text) {
    let words = text.split(/[ \r\n]+/);
    this.words = words.filter(c => c !== "");
    this.makeChains();
  }

  /** set markov chains:
   *
   *  for text of "the cat in the hat", chains will be
   *  {"the": ["cat", "hat"], "cat": ["in"], "in": ["the"], "hat": [null]} */

  makeChains() {
    // TODO
  }


  /** return random text from chains */

  makeText(numWords = 100) {
    // TODO
  }
}
```

The constructor function contains some code to get you started—given some input text, it splits it on spaces and linebreak characters to make a list of words. It then calls the (unimplemented) function which builds a map of chains of word → possible-next-words.

You should be able to instantiate it like this:

let mm = new MarkovMachine("the cat in the hat");

Then, whenever you want to get generated text from it:

```
mm.makeText();

mm.makeText(numWords=50);
```

Test this in the Node REPL before continuing! We’ve given you some text files to play with; you can feed these (or parts of these) into your machine to make sure it works.

    Write tests — which is tricky, since this algorithm is inherently random. There are things you can test, though — what are they?

Step 2: Build the makeText.js Script

We want a script, makeText.js, that works like this:

```
$ node makeText.js file eggs.txt
... generated text from file 'eggs.txt' ...

$ node makeText.js url http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
... generated text from that URL ...
```

Make sure it handles errors (can’t read file or can’t read URL) by printing a nice and complete error message and quitting program.
